<h1>Kawai K4</h1> 
<h2>Multi-Mode Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K4</b> and the <b>Kawai K4r</b>.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your K4 to receive Program Changes (RCV PGM) and Exclusive (RCV EXCL).  See pages 79 and 80 of the manual.  You'll also probably want your send channel and receive channel to be the same.  I wouldn't set the receive channel to OMNI, as this might conflict with drums.

<p><b>Hints</b>
<ul>
<li>The following effect patches are not used by any standard single, multi, or drum patch:  3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 28

<p><li>In all standard effect patches, Submix H is always "off".  
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b>

<ul>
<li>
You can't make parameter changes in real-time.

<p><li>When you send a patch, the name isn't updated: but the sound has in fact been changed.

</ul>
