<h1>Korg Wavestation SR</h1> 
<h2>Wave Sequence Editor</h2>

<p>This editor is designed work with the <b>Korg Wavestation SR</b>.  It will <b>not</b> work with any other Wavestation models (the original Wavestation, the Wavestation EX, or the Wavestation A/D).

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b> Set your SR to receive sysex parameters, and also to receive program change and bank select commands.  Turn off memory protect (including for your card if you need to).  Make sure that the MIDI channel set for the SR matches the one you're using in Edisyn.

<p>It is <b>very important</b> that you read the <b>Gotchas</b> below to understand Edisyn's strategy for building wave sequences, and why things can be slow.

<p>
<p><b>Hints</b>
<ul>
<li>Can't figure out how to access any Step beyond Step 1?  Click the "Number of Steps" button and increase the steps.  Warning: don't make this a big number (it takes a long time to make a large sequence).

<p><li>If the wave sequences are too narrow on the display, try changing the <b>Magnify</b> dial.
</ul>

<p><b>The Wavestation Menu</b>  
<ul>
<li>Wave Sequences must be auditioned by playing them in a Performance holding a Patch.  If you select <b>Set up Test Performance/Patch in RAM 1 Slot 0 Wave A</b>, Edisyn will temporarily modify Performance 1:0 so that it contains a single Part, at full volume, with no effects and default settings.  The Part will be Patch 1:0, consisting of a single Wave (A).  This Wave will be your current Wave Sequence.  Just don't write the Performance or the Patch and you'll be fine.
<p><li>You can also toggle on/off the soloing of the current step by selecting <b>Toggle Solo Step</b>.  You'll have to check the Wavestation to determine if you just turned soloing on or off (go to the Wave Sequence and see if the current wave has an "S" in its number).
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b>

<ul>
<li>There is no current working memory for wave sequences: any parameter changes you make will be immediately permanent.  Thus you should back up before using this editor.

<p><li>You cannot receive the current wave sequence (there is no "current" wave sequence).  You have to be specific about which wave sequence you want.

<p><li>The Wavestation doesn't have any way to receive a single wave sequence: it unfortunately expects to receive all wave sequences together as a huge 11Kbyte block.  Edisyn gets around this by sending all the parameters individually: but one parameter is a problem: the sequence length.  In order to change the sequence length, Edisyn must erase all the existing steps in the sequence, then repeatedly insert steps one by one until the desired length is reached, then set all the step parameter values.

<p><p>The problem is that inserting a step in a sequence is very fast if the sequence length is (initially) small, but as the length grows, so does the amount of time needed to do the insert.  Thus building a long sequence can take a very long time using this method.  If you want to build a short sequence, you might find it easier to build a sequence of length 1, and then gradually increase it by pressing the "Add Step" button.

<p><p>For this reason, Edisyn by default only changes step length when you click on the "Number of Steps" button.  The number of steps is not normally included when you send the Wave Sequence.  But you can change this behavior in the Wavestation menu.

<p><li>By default Performance 0 and Patch 0 are set up to play the given Wave Sequence so it can be auditioned.  You can turn this feature off in the Wavestation menu.

<p><li>Updating individual parameters is a little pokey.  This is because Edisyn must insert a significant delay between successive param
eter updates or they'll get dropped by the SR.

</ul>

<p><b>Notes</b>
<p>For the time being, I have elected to not have the patch editor update itself in response to manual parameter changes made directly on the synth.  The SR is just too complex a beast.
